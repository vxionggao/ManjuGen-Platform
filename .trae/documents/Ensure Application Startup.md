I will verify the status of the services and ensure the application is started successfully.

1. **Check Backend Status**: I will check the logs of the backend service (Terminal 6) to confirm that the latest code fixes (repairing the asynchronous task creation) have been successfully reloaded and the service is healthy.
2. **Restart if Necessary**: If the backend service is in an error state or has stopped, I will restart it.
3. **Provide Access**: Once confirmed running, I will provide the frontend access URL.
